    ##### Option 1: Online Compile
    1. [Import project into your mbed compiler workspace](http://developer.mbed.org/compiler/#import:https://github.com/mbartling/mbed-os-example-client/#b18623e).
    1. Add [`security.h` file from connector](https://connector.mbed.com/#credentials).
    1. Compile, download and then drag and drop code to your mbed Enabled board.
    1. **[Optional debug]** Hook up a serial terminal to the board for debug messages. You can verify connection to mbed Connector by checking the [API Console](https://connector.mbed.com/#console).

    ##### Option 2 : Offline Compile
    1. Clone project to your computer 
        `mbed import https://github.com/mbartling/mbed-os-example-client/#b18623e`.
    1. Add [`security.h` file from connector](https://connector.mbed.com/#credentials).
    1. Compile your code using `mbed compile` (for more info on mbed-cli see [here](https://youtu.be/PI1Kq9RSN_Y?list=PLiVCejcvpsetJ1n9nRXzLWvE4dp4RwGOf)).
    1. Drag and drop compiled binary (.bin file) from `BUILD` directory to the board.
    1. Wait for the blinking light to turn solid. This means the connection is complete.
    1. **[Optional debug]** Hook up a serial terminal to the board for debug messages. You can verify connection to mbed Connector by checking the [API Console](https://connector.mbed.com/#console).

    #### Troubleshooting
    If your board is having trouble connecting to wifi try resetting the system, many embedded wifi peripherals may require multiple connection attempts on their first connection to a new network.
